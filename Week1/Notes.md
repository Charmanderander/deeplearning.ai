## What is a neural network?

Each neuron is a unit of function. ReLU function is an example of a neuron.

ReLU function (Rectified Linear Unit) = `max(0,:)`

A neural network is stacking several neurons together

Neural networks combines several features together, and tries to make a new hidden feature using feature interaction.

## Supervised Neural Network

Given input features, predict an output target `y`, which can be binary, or multiclass

Different problems uses different deep learning models:

- Images: CNN
- Sequence data (Text, Audio): RNN/LSTM
- Others: Standard FF NN
